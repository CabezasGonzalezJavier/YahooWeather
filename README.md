# About
  This project:
        - MVP.
        - GSON.
  
  I chose MVP(Model, View, Presenter).
  View is a layer that displays data and reacts to user actions. On Android, this could be an Activity, a Fragment, 
  an android.view.View or a Dialog.
  Model is a data access layer such as database API or remote server API.
  Presenter is a layer that provides View with data from Model. Presenter also handles background tasks.
  On Android MVP is a way to separate background tasks from activities/views/fragments to make them independent 
  of most lifecycle-related events. This way an application becomes simpler, overall application reliability 
  increases up to 10 times, application code becomes shorter, code maintainability becomes better and developer's 
  life becomes happier.
  
  Gson (also known as Google Gson) is an open source Java library to serialize and deserialize 
  Java objects to (and from) JSON.
